## Version Control System

### - Java, Git Internals, Data Structures
Implemented Java-based version control system emulating Git's 3-stage architecture (working, staging, remote) with add, commit, log, checkout, merge. Designed branching and merging with conflict resolution; enabled smooth parallel development workflows.
